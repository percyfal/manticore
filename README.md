# manticore

manticore provides utility functions for dealing with output from
various R packages that analyse variation data, typically in the
variant call format (vcf). Despite the name, manticore can be used
with model organism data. However, the motivation for the package is
that non model organism data display certain features often require
hacks, such as a large number of scaffolds without linkage map
information. In particular, the majority of functions in manticore
facilitate creating genome-wide plots of various types of data
