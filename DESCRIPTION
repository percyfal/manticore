Package: manticore
Title: Utility functions for analysis of non model organism data
Version: 0.0.0.9009

Description: manticore provides utility functions for dealing with
    output from various R packages that analyse variation
    data, typically in the variant call format (vcf). Despite
    the name, manticore can be used with model organism data.
    However, the motivation for the package is that non model
    organism data display certain features that often require
    hacks, such as a large number of scaffolds without
    linkage map information. In particular, the majority of
    functions in manticore facilitate creating genome-wide
    plots of various types of data.
